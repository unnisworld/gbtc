/**
 * Responsible for allocating the shortest possible path for a journey to a
 * Vehicle.
 * 
 * Shortest possible path calculation strategy is dependent on the
 * implementation of {@code PathCalculationStrategy} that is supplied to it
 * during construction. The path thus obtained for a journey is checked for any
 * possible collision with vehicles in transit using the
 * {@code RouteConflictChecker}. If a conflict is detected, then an empty path
 * is returned and vehicle is expected to retry after sometime.
 * 
 * Known Limitation : If the suggested path collides with an in-transit
 * vehicle's path it doesn't have the capability to find an alternative path
 * which may be slightly longer.
 * 
 * @ThreadSafe : This class is designed as a Thread Safe class. All methods in
 *             this implementation are marked as synchronized as they either
 *             mutate the internal state or depend on the internal state to
 *             deliver correct results.
